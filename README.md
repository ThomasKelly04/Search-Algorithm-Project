# Search-Algorithm-Project

The vast majority of the code for this project was generated using chatGPT, with the prompt being ripped straight from the assignment verbage with a little tweaking to make it more palatable for an AI. (mostly removing non-project related text/summarizing sections into more basic goals)
I also used chatGPT to debug certain aspects of the code, like when the time keeping function wasn't working correctly (saying every attempted algorithm took 0.0 seconds due to a rounding error)
